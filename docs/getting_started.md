## Installation

To get started with Z-Dash Lite, you'll need to download and install the Z-Dash Lite IDE.

### Steps

1. **Download Z-Dash Lite IDE:**
   - Visit the [Z-Dash Lite GitHub repository](https://github.com/Zdash-Developers/Z-dash-Lite/releases) and download the latest version of the Z-Dash Lite IDE executable (`1.exe`).

2. **Handling Antivirus Warnings:**
   - Some antivirus programs, including McAfee and Windows Defender, may falsely identify the executable as a virus. This is a common issue with executables created from Python scripts. The software is safe to use.

#### How to Whitelist the File:

**Windows Defender:**
1. Open Windows Security.
2. Go to "Virus & threat protection".
3. Under "Virus & threat protection settings", click "Manage settings".
4. Scroll down to "Exclusions" and click "Add or remove exclusions".
5. Add the downloaded file to the exclusions list.

**McAfee:**
1. Open McAfee and go to "Real-Time Scanning".
2. Click "Excluded Files".
3. Add the downloaded file to the exclusions list.

## Writing Your First Program
